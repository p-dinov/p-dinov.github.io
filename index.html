                    <p>So, have you heard of the house on the hill
                        I hear it's haunted, and crawling with all types of evil
                        But I am not afraid of any legends or lores
                        And I want answers to what might be behind all these doors
                        Knocking and waiting for some sort of reply
                        It seems there's nobody in here, and I want to know why
                        I can feel a shiver crawling way up my spine
                        but I know there's something that's waiting at the end of the line

                        Another door, another question
                        I'm going 'round in circles, wond'ring when I'll reach the end
                        I'm losing the sense of where I am
                        The hallways got longer and all the walls have turned red

                        I’ve come to, 900, hands covered in sores
                        Now there are only, 100 of these spine-chilling doors
                        But I just can’t imagine what could be at the end
                        and I am hoping, it’s all worth it to my little friend
                        Spooky, what is it that you’re hiding from me?
                        I feel there’s something, that’s missing don’t know what it could be
                        I just finished opening nine hundred and three
                        Will I survive it, until the end there’s no guarantee</p>

                    <p>The final, encounter, was so unforeseen
                        Everything I thought, of Spooky wasn't quite what it seemed
                        The evidence I came across gave me just the thing
                        To understand more, of Spooky and her sad upbringing
                        Lost and, so lonely and so misunderstood
                        Turns out the thing she, loved most to do had done her in good
                        The shock of what had happened lasted year after year
                        And so the family, did everything to make her appear

                        The final door, the ultimatum
                        Surrounded by a thousand and I can’t help but give in
                        Our mission, to change our history
                        The people will think twice when visited by Spooky</p>
